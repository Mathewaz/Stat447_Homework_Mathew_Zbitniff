First, we load the data. Notice that we use the "here" function. 
```{r}
library("here")
mydata<-read.csv(here("Homework 1", "hyper.csv"))
head(mydata)
```

Now since we have the data loaded properly, we can start the analysis:

```{r}
ncol(mydata)
nrow(mydata)
sum(is.na(mydata))
nrow(mydata[rowSums(is.na(mydata)) > 0,])
```
The above results tell us that in our data we have 5 columns and 1000 rows, there are 453 NA's within 307 rows. 



Now, we check the summary of the data:

```{r}
summary(mydata)
```


# ```{r, echo = F, fig.dim = c(9, 9)}
# summary(mydata)
# pairs(mydata, panel=panel.smooth)
# ```

#need to figure out how to comment so wont show up in pdf
